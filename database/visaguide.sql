They apply for their visas after U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) approves the H-1B petition your employer filed on your behalf. Your family can obtain their H-4 visas at the same time you obtain your H-1B visa, or they can obtain their H-4 visas&nbsp;after&nbsp;you obtain your H-1B visa—they just cannot obtain their visas&nbsp;before&nbsp;you obtain yours.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">The process for obtaining H-4 status is different if the H-1B worker and family are already in the United States (in which case, technically speaking, they cannot seek a \"visa,\" which is first and foremost an entry document). In this situation, the family must file an I-539 application to change their status with USCIS. All family members can be included in one I-539 form. We are presuming they are in the U.S. legally and maintaining lawful status—undocumented persons including those who have, for example, overstayed a visa, cannot file for a change of status.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">For example, let’s say you are in the U.S. with an F-1 student visa and your wife and son are in the U.S. with F-2 visas. You find an employer who sponsors you for an H-1B visa by filing an H-1B petition (Form I-129) with USCIS. Your family can file their I-539 application either at the same time as your I-129 petition, or anytime afterward. Once USCIS approves the I-129, it will then approve the I-539 and change your family’s status to H-4.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">It is VERY important to remember to file an I-539 application to make sure your family maintains legal status in the United Status. Remember, your family’s status is dependent upon yours—they are allowed to be in the U.S. because they are your dependents. In the example above, as soon as your F-1 status ends, your family’s F-2 status also terminates. Therefore, if you forgot to file an I-539 to change their status from F-2 to H-4, your family could be in the U.S. without lawful status, which can lead to very serious consequences and jeopardize their future opportunities to live in the United States.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">One more thing to remember: Because a change of status does not provide an actual visa, your family members will, if they travel outside the U.S. with H-4 status, need to make a stop at a U.S. consulate in order to get an H-4 visa for return to the United States. This shouldn\'t present a big hurdle, given that USCIS already approved the change of status—but it is an important step to remember, nonetheless.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Six options for H4 Visa spouse in the USA:</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">1.
